# small-app
This application serves as a general purpose, single-repository microservices driven architecture.

The `frontend` and `backend` directories represent a service, which at scale, ideally have an actual physical separation (e.g., in individual repositories). This design is by no means perfect, but it possesses fundamentals for scalability and portability.
